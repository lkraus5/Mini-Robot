This is meant to be a simple easy to run robot powered by Raspberry pi and using a Playstation Dualshock 4 Controller.

This can be setup so the controller signals are sent over wifi to the bot 
where it is interpreted by the pi and propelled by the Adafruit Motor controller

more updates on this to come
